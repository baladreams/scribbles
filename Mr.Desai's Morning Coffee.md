# Mr. Desai's Morning Kaapi

It cannot be overstated that Mr.Desai was a creature of habit: so regular, so punctual, so predictable was he. It was said by many that it was 6 o' clock when Mr.Desai visited Rangan's coffee stall, instead of saying Mr. Desai visits Rangan's coffee stall at 6 o' clock. Mr.Desai's life had been dull, predictable and predictably dull for the last two decades: He was at Rangan's coffee shop at 6 o'clock , at the bus stop at 8'o clock, at his desk in his office at 10'o clock, at one of the various tiffin centers littering the streets at 6'o clock , and snoring in his bed by 9 o' clock. The rains might disappoint expectant Chennai residents time and again, but Mr.Desai never did.

Mr.Desai's day dawned not when the sun rose, that was merely happenstance. His day did not dawn as he settled in his usual seat at Rangan's coffee stall.  Hearing Rangan chime 'Good morning Mr.Desai! Give me two minutes, let me heat fresh milk for your coffee. Why don't you have two butter biscuits in the meantime?' and his usual reply 'No hurry Rangan, take your time'. Watching with expectant eyes as Rangan, with the grace of a practiced prestidigitator, magicked the coffee from the raised tumbler to the one below in turns as froth emerged billowing over hot steaming coffee. Receiving the warm steel tumbler from Rangan, filled to the brim with hot steaming madras filter kaapi. His day only dawned as he took the first sip, the magic brown liquid flowed and suffused him with vigor. After more than four-and-half decades of drinking coffee, Mr.Desai simply could not do without it.

Rangan himself was next in importance only to his filter kaapi. Rangan was the opposite to Mr.Desai in many respects. Where Mr.Desai was shy and reserved, barely conversing with anyone, Rangan was the kind of person who could have one-on-one conversations with ten people simultaneously. Where Mr.Desai, unusual for his time and tradition, still lived on his own, Rangan could always be heard boasting about his son's important role in the railway project or his granddaughter's brilliant dance performance at her primary school program. Where Mr.Desai hardly spoke two words, Rangan could hardly even manage less than two thousand. But despite being polar opposites, Mr.Desai had been going every day, come rain or shine, storm or endless summer after summer (famously Chennai's only season) to Rangan's coffee shop, listened patiently as he orated on national news, local politics, the upcoming election and his granddaughter's artistry nodding and hm-ing at all the right times.

Were they friends? It is hard to say that, they had never visited each other's homes or broken fast together. Were they colleagues? Surely not, Mr.Desai works in an office room in the city whereas Rangan owned a tea stall. Were they simply customer and businessman? One can say that, if only one were deficit of imagination and prosaic of thought. Rangan supplied, day after day, the most important need in Mr.Desai's life and in return Mr.Desai graciously shared his good fortune in the form of currency and gratitude: the relationship was symbiotic and selfless. For two decades, they had served to each other's mirror, seeing and observing the other through the ups and downs and the long slow medians of the other's life. They had met when their mustaches were fresh black, and still met every day as they slowly, surely turned silver with the seasons.

There was no question that the sun would rise sooner in the west than there would be a day when Mr.Desai was not seen in Rangan's coffee shop at 6 o' clock. The sun they said would cease to exist one day, and that did seem more believable than Mr.Desai not keeping to his habits.

And yet, nature has a way of contriving the impossible to pass, and there came the day. Mr.Desai, eyes still heavy-lidded and brain still half-asleep (as it always was before his filter kaapi) , ambled and shuffled to Rangan's store and ascended the small, low flight of stairs to Rangan's shop still staring at his phone, when he froze on his tracks. There was no warm flow emanating from inside the store, no spell of fresh filter coffee wafting in delicious waves from inside, no smiling Rangan with his perky usual morning salutations: he was greeted by the steel shutters, drawn down and locked.

Mr.Desai was puzzled, and concerned. Such an occasion had not occurred in over two decades, and he was ill equipped to handle it. What had happened? Where was Rangan? What would he do now? How will his day begin without Rangan's filter kaapi? Questions raged in Mr.Desai's mind, with such speed and volume that even filter kaapi was pushed aside. Flustered, breathless, Mr.Desai overcame his reserved nature to enquire the nearby shopkeepers. 'Good morning Muthu. Rangan's shop appears closed.. do you know why? where does he happen to be?' he enquired. 'I am not sure Desai sir, I have not heard anything about it'. Muthu's lack of answers seemed to add to his own paucity. Same with Rajam, the owner of the shop on the other side. To Mr.Desai, everywhere seemed to be shutters.

Unsure of how to proceed, Mr.Desai went to a different coffee shop, and his face grimaced: what brew was this? It was too bitter, and it suffused him with no warmth. He then left for his office on his usual schedule, surely tomorrow would dawn and the world would be right side up again. But hopes were made to be dashed opined the cruel world, and Mr.Desai ran into the shutter again. He went to a different shop today, and his face grimaced: what brew was this? it was too watery, and it gave him no warmth. Then the next day dawned, and then another and each day brought with it the same shutter, a different brew and a different reason to grimace : too sweet, no foam, a glass tumbler? glass? The horrors of the world knew no bounds. There was no warmth to be had, and his hope itself seemed to drain bit by bit. Worrying thoughts continued to follow him wherever he went unbidden.

But Mr.Desai was undeterred. It had been a week since Rangan's shop had first appeared closed. Mr.Desai started at his usual time, and as he shuffled over same low stairs, he fully expected to be greeted by the shutters again. Oh, how  just seven days of change overshadow two decades of habit! It was his nose that noticed it first, before his eyes beheld anything. There it was, unmistakable in its familiarity: the alluring scent of madras filter kaapi! Mr.Desai rushed up the remaining stairs breathlessly. And there it was, as it always had been: the warm glow bathing his being, the aroma of filter kaapi swaddling him in comfort and certainty and finally 'Good morning Mr.Desai! Mannikkanum sir! my granddaughter had fallen ill and i had to rush to her side. But not to worry she is all well and healthy now, back to her own tricks and mischief! I apologize for not telling you before i left sir' beamed Rangan, magicking froth onto filter coffee. Mr.Desai hesitated for a moment, teetering between disbelief and belief, much as one who had read his lottery ticket's numbers in the winning announcement.

And warmth suffused Mr.Desai's being, the smile widening on his face even before he intoned 'Enna Rangan, parava illa. It was no problem. But I did sorely miss your filter kaapi!'. Perhaps, it was not the kaapi that dawned Mr.Desai's day all these years, who could say? But it was 6 o' clock. Mr.Desai was sitting on his usual seat in Rangan's stall, sipping filter kaapi, nodding at all the right places as Rangan related with relish how his granddaughter played a trick on him. And all was right with the world again.
