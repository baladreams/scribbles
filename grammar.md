What Is An Adjective?
Simple test: Does it answer one of these questions about a noun?

Which one? (first, last, next, other)
What kind? (happy, sad, wooden, metal)
How many? (three, several, many, few)
Whose? (possessives don't count as adjectives, but other ownership words do)

If YES to any → It's an adjective


ossessives vs. ownership words
You asked: "What is a possessive or other ownership word?"
Possessives (NOT adjectives):

My, your, his, her, its, our, their
These show WHO owns something
"My book" / "Her car" / "Their house"
Not considered adjectives for this exercise

Other ownership (ARE adjectives):

"The teacher's book" (teacher's = possessive form, functions as adjective)
"John's car" (John's = possessive, describes which car)
These ARE adjectives technically, but we'll allow them


No ; before but

It's is it is, Its indicates ownership

no space before :
