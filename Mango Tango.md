# Mango Tango 

"Mahalakshmi! Glad you are here today! where were you the last two days? I was looking for you across the market!"

"Welcome Meena amma (madam, mother figure)! My daughter has come from her grandparents in the village, so I had to take a couple of days to get her settled."

"I see! It is good that you did so! How is she? is she doing well? is she adjusting to life here?"

"Yes amma, she is doing well! she is still adjusting to life in the city, a lot is new for her here! I am thinking of having her help me"

"That is good, she too should learn a trade! It will aid her well. Here is my bag Maha, give me five mangos, one to offer to each sanctum."

"How much do i owe you?"

"One mango is 200 rupees amma, so five is.. one thousand rupees amma. Let me put it in a bag for you"

"TWO Hundred! For ONE mango! Are these mangos the heavenly fruit talked about in mythical tales to command such a price?"

"These are fresh, ripe Banganapalli mangoes (a common mango variety) amma! look at their color! smell the fragrance! feel how ripe and tender they are."

"These are only Banganapalli mangoes, not even Imam (a more exclusive mango variety). That is too much, too much! I will give 150 rupees per mango, that is more than fair. Here, go ahead and fill my bag."

"That will not do Amma, I cannot do that! I have to go all the way to wholesale market, amma. In a crowded bus, in the sweltering heat. I stand here all day, under the burning sun, and ensure the fruits remain fresh even if I brown under it. The mangoes grew from the earths water amma, but they are here after my hard work and sweat!"

"I accept all that Maha, do you think I do not work hard too! I too trudge day and night to my school on a bus, in autos, through the dust and the heat. I stand all day, every day, to ensure the students and their minds do not rot! At least your fruits do not actively seek to roll away and rot!"

"See amma, then you can understand my difficulties and problems. I have to keep my family up. You understand that. You are educated, knowledgeable. You know what is fair, right from wrong. Can one such as you ask for such a low price amma?"

"Fine, fine Maha. I have to rush. I do not have the time to keep arguing with you. Tell me finally, cut and right: how much do you want per mango?"

"Amma what am i going to get in profits? a mere thirty rupees amma. But you have been coming to my fruit stall for years, you always buy from me. Do not think of me of thankless for your patronage over the years. I will take much less, even if it is at my own expense. Just to please you amma"

"Okay okay Maha. Tell me, finally, what do you want per mango?"

"One hundred and seventy five rupees amma, i will make a mere five to ten rupees per mango.. only for you amma, for no one else will i ever give such a deal!"

"Fill the bag and give it here. Here, eight hundred seventy five rupees. count them to ensure I have paid correctly"

"Amma, I trust and respect you too much to count your money! It will no doubt be correct. Here is your bag amma!"

"Thank you Maha! Give my best to your daughter"

"I will amma! do not forget to come to my stall next time too! I will be here!"

...

"Hello. Ponnu (girl), is this not Maha's.. Mahalakshmi's fruit stall? where is she?"

"Vanakkam (Welcome) amma! She is not here today.. she had to leave for some urgent work. I am Saraswathi, her daughter. Can I help you today?"

"Ah, so you are Maha's girl! I am so happy to meet you. I am Meena, I have been your mother's customer for a long time. She had told me about you, that you had moved back in with her recently. Have you settled in well? How are you finding the city? Have you adjusted?"

"Yes amma, thank you for asking. I am still learning my way around. I have heard of you from my mother as well! I am grateful to have met you amma."

"Oh really! Hopefully she only said good things about me!"

"Yes amma, without question! She had told of how you always pick her stall and how generous you are!"

"That is so gratifying to hear. Here Saraswathi, can you give me five mangos in this bag please?"

"Of course amma, right away. Five mangoes.. is one thousand rupees amma!"

"You are just like your mother Saraswathi! That is too high.. how about one hundred and seventy five per mango? Here is eight hundred seventy five rupees."

"Amma that is.. okay amma, as you say. Here are your mangoes"

"Saraswathi.. come here a second please kanna (dear)"

"Yes amma?"

"Saraswathi.. if you accept what the customer says right away, they will try to push you even lower. They will try to take advantage of you. You need to haggle a bit, push back slightly. That way, you can still settle on a good price for your goods! a couple of rounds of back and forth are all but essential! Here, go back to your side and let's try! ensure that you haggle a bit, and try to get a better price from me!"

"Okay amma.. I understand, thank you!"

"Amma, that is too low. I am new to this trade amma, yours are the blessed hands to whom I am going to make my first ever sale! I see you as Ambal (Hindu goddess) herself come to light my way in the trade. Such a learned elder as you, should you not show kindness towards a girl your daughter's age amma, and offer a slightly fairer price?"

".. You are a fast learner! what would be fair Saraswathi?"

"How about one hundred eighty per mango amma?"

"Sounds.. fair! Here is nine hundred rupees" 

"Thank you Amma! here are your mangoes! Please remember to continue to come to our stall! I will wait for you!"
